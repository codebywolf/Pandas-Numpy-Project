# 📊 E-commerce Sales Analysis Using Pandas & NumPy

This is a beginner-friendly data analysis project where I explored a fictional Indian e-commerce dataset using only **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Jupyter Notebook**.

The dataset contains 100+ order records with details such as product, category, city, price, quantity, and order date. The goal was to apply fundamental Pandas operations to derive useful business insights.
